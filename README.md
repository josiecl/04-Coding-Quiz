# 04-Coding-Quiz
This is an interactive coding quiz that will give the player 50 seconds to answer 5 questions. If a question is answered incorrectly, 10 seconds will be taken off the timer. If the player reaches the end with a timer count of > 0, they will be able to submit their initials along with their score, which will appear on the high score board.

# Why it was made
This quiz allows for the player to learn a couple of fun facts about dogs. I know a lot about dogs, and think they're really cool, so I want the player to be able to learn stuff as well.

# What I learned
Because of this quiz, I was able to learn about setting displays, and feel very comfortable with that now. Not only that, but I had never used an array in this way before. For this quiz, I used one array to set questions, answers, and the right/wrong answer, and this was really interesting to learn. I also got introduced to local storage usage, and how to pull up information from a local storage and paste it on a page. I also grew more comfortable with Javascript because of this assignment.

# Challenges
I ran into several challenges while making this quiz. First and foremost, I was not sure at all how to get the questions to progress when answered, and how to keep the timer in sync. Occasionally, when the quiz would end, the time would show up 10 seconds off from the final time. I fixed this by changing the timer in the corner to say "complete" when the quiz is completed, or "out of time" if the time reaches or goes below 0. I also ran into issues with using local storage, and pasting it to the page, and sorting the scores. I, thankfully, was able to reach out to my teaching instructor, who greatly helped me through this. It was a very challenging assignment, but I learned a lot thanks to it.

# End result
I am very happy with the end result website. The quiz works as it should, and I think the design is very fun. I had a lot of fun with the CSS, and learned a lot more about Javascript. I'm proud of this website. It was a very cool assignment, and I'm glad to have been able to complete it.
